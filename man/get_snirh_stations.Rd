\title{Get SNIRH station information}
\usage{
get_snirh_stations(matrix = "surface.water", timeout = 30, active_only = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{Character string specifying the matrix type. Currently supports
"surface.water" and "biota" (both use the same station database).}

\item{timeout}{Numeric. Timeout in seconds for downloading data. Default is 30.}

\item{active_only}{Logical. If TRUE, returns only active stations (Estado = "ATIVA").
If FALSE, returns all stations. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A data.table with station information containing:
\describe{
\item{station_id}{Station identifier (corresponds to "CÃ³digo" in SNIRH)}
\item{status}{Station status (e.g., "ATIVA", "EXTINTA")}
\item{geometry}{Spatial geometry (if sf package is available)}
}
}
\description{
Downloads and returns information about SNIRH monitoring stations for
surface water quality. This function can be used to check station status,
get available station IDs, or validate stations before data conversion.
}
\details{
Downloads the latest station information from the SNIRH
geoportal. It requires an internet connection and the 'sf' package for
processing shapefiles.

The station database includes information about:
\itemize{
\item Station location (coordinates)
\item Station status (active/inactive)
\item Station metadata
}
}
\section{Station Status}{

Stations can have different status values:
\describe{
\item{ATIVA}{Station is active and can receive new data}
\item{INATIVA}{Station is inactive (historical data only)}
\item{EXTINTA}{Station is permanently suspended and has no data}
}
}

\examples{
# Get all surface water stations
all_stations <- get_snirh_stations("surface.water")
print(head(all_stations))

# Get only active stations
active_stations <- get_snirh_stations("surface.water", active_only = TRUE)
print(paste("Active stations:", nrow(active_stations)))

# Check if specific stations are active
my_stations <- c("07H/50", "25G/07")
station_info <- get_snirh_stations("surface.water")
station_status <- station_info[station_id \%in\% my_stations]
print(station_status)
